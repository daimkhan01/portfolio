## `Getting Started`

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd your-portfolio
Install dependencies:npm install
Run the app: npm start
Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## `Available Scripts`

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Removes the single build dependency from the project and allows full control over the configuration files. This action is irreversible.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Deployment

To deploy your portfolio, follow these steps:

1.Build the app: npm run build
2.Deploy the build folder to your hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

For more details, refer to the Create React App deployment documentation.

### Technologies Used

React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
Create React App: Bootstrapped the project with React.
CSS: For styling the components.
Node.js: For managing dependencies and running scripts.
